# S3
- storage for **object**
- region base
- durability
  - replicate the data in multiple AZs
- availability
## concept
  - bucket
  - region
  - object & key
    - object key / key: file name
  - s3 data consistency model
    - strong read-after-write consistency
      - After modifying, you can only get the resources after all the data be the same
    - eventual consistency
      - 最終一致

## prefix
When we store the object, AWS service will hash the prefix. Therefore, the object will be written in the disk randomly. This step low down the probability that extreme situations happen.


# how to move data to s3
- CLI
- console
- SDKs 
## move large data to s3
- multipart upload
  - seperate to many parts for uploading, then merge them after all parts upload successfully
  > 這是因為s3可能有一次上傳大小限制，所以用這招把obj拆開來傳
    - No matter all parts of object is uploaded or not, it will cause some cost.
    - bucket **life cycle** could check whether all parts are uploaded successfully.

## S3 transfer acceleration
- use cloudFront to accelerate
- will generate a new endpoint for uploading

## snow family
- use hardware for transfering data
- could do some simple computing during transfering
### AWS snowbcone
- high durability
### AWS snowball edge
- storing data in TB level(100TB)
- users could choose to inhance its computing or storage

### AWS snowmobile
- PB level 

## storage gateway
- transfer data from on-premises data center to different destination, e.g. S3, EBS, s3 glacier, AWS backup, ...

# access control of s3
## how to share files to others 
- In default, we could not share data in S3 to others AWS account
- for single obj
  - modify the ACL, then turn one object to public
  - others can get data through object URL
- for whole bucket
  - bucket policy 
## block public access
- 防呆機制
- 若關掉但沒設置bocket policy, 仍不為公開, 僅是可以公開
## cross-origin resource sharing
- when 2 websites need to access data from each other

## pre-signed URL
- temporary access to S3
- choose to allow read or write or both
- cannot use console
  - CLI
  - SDK, e.g. JAVA, .NET, ...

## access point
- is use for target group of people
- permission will be set with access point and bucket policy
  - if AP allow but bucket policy deny, the action will be denied

## data protection
- use data versioning
  - 可以回溯過去資源，避免誤刪資料
- Once version enable, we cannot turn off it
  - only suspend, cannot terminate this
  - every versions are objs
    - cost
  - MFA delete
     - when permanently delete a version
       - if S3 no versions, we can delete without MFA
     - only **root account** can
## encryption
### how to do
- for transit
  - SSL/TLS
- at rest
  - server side
    - SSE-S3
    - SSE-KMS
      - use KMS for controling the key
    - SSE-C
      - key provided by customer
      - AWS will not remember the key you send, it only remember the encrypted obj
- client side
  - customer fully manage

## replication
- can replicate to different type of S3
- The replication of origin S3 will be modified automatically
### CRR (cross region replication)
- reduce latency
- compliance
  - 有些國家的合規性要求要備份在遠一點的國家
- Increase operational efficiency
  - e.g. 提昇網頁效率
### SRR (same-region replication )
- multi-account
  - e.g. user has a test account and another account for deploy, but he still want these 2 acc not to be different for a lot
- collect data for analyse
- compliance
