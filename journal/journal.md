I got the offer on 7/1. HR send me a link of training courses after checking electronic self documents I had sent. The records of learning from the online resources provided by ECV are placed in "2024_Internship_Hand-on_practice" folder.

Learning how to build cloud architectures sometimes will be unaffordable for student like us. However, there is no need to pay in all the workshops I take. Really appreciate.

Today is Onboard day. I was assigned into MSP team with two international students. For me, it is a huge challenge because I'm not good at English speaking. However, in fact, I found that my English speaking skill has been improved a little after a whole day.

All the interns had a test in the afternoon, and it seems as hard as SAA for me. I'll keep studying hard for understanding the usage of AWS services! Hope every things will be great in the coming three months!
